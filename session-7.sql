-- 1.Write an SQL query to display all products from a 'products' table and sort them by price in ascending order, similar to how Flipkart lists items from lowest to highest price.

use music_streaming_app ;

select * from products
order by price asc ;

-- 2. Modify your previous query to show the top 5 most expensive products using ORDER BY with DESC and LIMIT. 

select * from products 
order by price desc
limit 5;

-- 3. Given a 'movies' table with columns 'title', 'release_year', and 'rating', write an SQL query to list all movies sorted first by release_year in descending order (latest first), then by rating in descending order (highest rated first). 

select * from movies
order by release_year desc,
rating desc ;

-- 4. Write an SQL query to display the first 10 restaurants from a 'restaurants' table, sorted alphabetically by name, just like Zomato's A-Z listing.

select * from restaurants
order by name 
limit 10;

-- 5. Suppose you want to display the top 3 trending songs from a 'songs' table based on play_count, but if two songs have the same play_count, the more recently added song should come first. Write the SQL query to achieve this.

select * from songs
order by play_count desc, added_date desc
limit 3;
